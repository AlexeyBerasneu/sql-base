## üß† SQL Tasks to Practice

### üî∏ Basic Queries
1. List all accounts with their brokers and opening dates.  
2. Show all stocks with their sectors and exchanges.  
3. Find the top-3 most frequently traded stocks.  
4. For each account, calculate:  
   - total commissions paid,  
   - total traded volume (`SUM(price * quantity)`).

### üî∏ Aggregations and Grouping
5. Calculate the average trade price for each stock.

### üî∏ Financial Analytics
6. Find stocks traded on multiple exchanges.

### üî∏ Window Functions
7. For each broker, calculate the percentage of trades per exchange  
   (e.g., Robinhood ‚Äî 60% NASDAQ, 40% NYSE).  

## üéØ Learning Goals

This project helps to:
- Understand table relationships: one-to-many and many-to-many.  
- Practice joins, grouping, subqueries, and window functions.  
- Learn to calculate percentages, rankings, and moving totals.  
- Build a clean SQL project suitable for a GitHub portfolio.
